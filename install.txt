);
%PluginConf = (

                max_lines => 100000, # Limit number of records to be processed by nfdump for each channel
                time_difference => 3000, # Time difference (in ms) within the same flow among various channels
                www_dir => '/nfsen', # output web server nfsen directory path (default /nfsen)
        },
